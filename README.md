# CS370-Repo

1. Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

  For this project, we were given the base code for a pirate treasure game to be solved by an AI agent. Our goal was to implement code to set the Q-Training Algorithm in the Treasure Hunt Game. The purpose was to ensure that we found the best possible sequence of steps to find the treasure while maximizing rewards. 

  We were given the code to set the environment, replay experience, the build model, and the game play. The portion of the code we had to build was the Q-Training algorithm. 

2. Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

a. What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  Computer scientists study, design, develop, and analyize computer systems and algorithms. Computer scientists are important, as they drive advancement and innovation in technology, such as develop algorithms that lead to faster data processing and creating innovated applications that enhance communication and collaboration. They also play a crucial role in cyber security, ensuring applications are protected from cyber threats and sensitive data is safeguarded. Finally, computer scientists directly help design solutions that help automate processes and lead to a higher overall efficiency.

b. How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  As a computer scientist, my first step is to understand the problem, which is usually done by gathering requirements and researching and analyzing the problem. From there, I would plan my approach by breaking the problem down into smaller sub-problems or tasks. After this, it is important to design the structure and architecture so the code has a solid base to build off of. The next step is to write code based on that design. Once the code is implemented, I would test it thoroughly to ensure all works, then document and communicate the code before finally deploying and maintaining it. 
  
c. What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  As a computer scientist, I have ethical responsibilities to ensure the user privacy of the end user, and I must implement robust data protection measures. It is also important to develop systems that are fair and without bias, and provide transparent information about how user data and information is collected.
  Towards my organization, it is important to adhere to legal and regulatory requirements related to data protection and intellectual property. Additionally, I must respect intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, and trademarks. Finally, I must matinain professionalism and integrity in my interactions with colleagues, clients, and stakeholders.
